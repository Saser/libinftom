This is a small project accompanying the course TMV027 Finite Automata Theory and Formal Languages, given at Chalmers University of Technology in Spring 2016.

I am writing it since the teacher encouraged us to write programs in our favorite programming languages that would work with DFA/NFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton/Non-deterministic Finite Automaton).

Some day I would like to create a web service using this library, so that other people can use it as well.

## Why `libinftom`?
In Swedish, the course is called "Ändliga automater och formella språk", but the course is among students jokingly called "Oändliga Tomater" since it sounds very similar to "Ändliga automater". "Oändliga Tomater" basically means "Infinite Tomatoes", which is where I got the name from.
